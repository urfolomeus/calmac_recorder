# CalMac ferry recorder

A tool that pulls service information from the CalMac website and records whether or not a ferry sailed.


## Development

The majority of the code is located in the `lib` folder, with tests in the `spec` folder. Please be sure to cover any code you write with tests to make it easier for me to know what the intent of your code is and whether it works with everything else. :)


## Tests

```bash
bundle
bin/rspec
```
